### Era switch to Pythagoras

We have introduced the **Pythagoras era** in the Mithril networks. The switch to `Pythagoras` is a significant milestone that brings new features and improvements to the Mithril protocol.

:::danger
**Mithril signer versions** compatible with the new `Pythagoras` era are:

- `v.0.2.221`
- `v.0.2.209`
- `v.0.2.200`

All other versions are **not** compatible with the new era and must be updated.
:::

:::tip
You can easily update your Mithril signer with this one-line command (it will be downloaded to the current directory by default; you can specify a custom folder with the `-p` option):


```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/mithril/refs/heads/main/mithril-install.sh | sh -s -- -c mithril-signer -d latest -p $(pwd)
```

#### Era switch plan for `Pythagoras`

- **Pre-release-preview** network:  
  - [x] Create the era switch transaction (done at epoch `757`)  
  - [x] Complete the era switch to `Pythagoras` at the transition to epoch `759`

- **Release-preprod** network:  
  - [x] Create the era switch transaction (done at epoch `184`) 
  - [x] Complete the era switch to `Pythagoras` at the transition to epoch `186`

- **Release-mainnet** network:  
  - [ ] Create the era switch transaction (planned for early January 2025)
  - [ ] Complete the era switch to `Pythagoras`

:::info
We use the **era switch mechanism** to introduce breaking changes in the Mithril protocol. Because these features are not backward compatible with the previous era, at least **95% of the stake** must be running the new version for `Pythagoras` to activate. Refer to the [Mithril network upgrade strategy](https://mithril.network/doc/adr/4) ADR for more details.
