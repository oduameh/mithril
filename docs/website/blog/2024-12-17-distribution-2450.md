### Distribution `2450` is now available

We have released the [`2450.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2450.0) distribution, which includes the following:

- :fire: **Breaking changes** in the Mithril client library, CLI, and WASM:
  - Removed the deprecated `network` field from the internal `CardanoDbBeacon`
  - Mithril certificates of type `CardanoImmutableFilesFull` cannot be verified with older clients
  - Clients from distribution `2445` and earlier **must** be updated
- Stable support for **Cardano node v.10.1.3** in the signer and aggregator
- Stable support for a one-line shell installation script for the Mithril node prebuilt binaries
- Various bug fixes and performance improvements.

This new distribution has been deployed to the **Mithril aggregator** of the `release-mainnet` and `release-preprod` networks.

If you are running a **Mithril signer**:

- **Pre-release-preview** network: no action is required at this time
- **Release-preprod** network: upgrade your signer node binary to version `0.2.221`. No configuration updates are required
- **Release-mainnet** network: upgrade your signer node binary to version `0.2.221`. No configuration updates are required.

You can easily update your Mithril signer with this one-line command (it downloads to the current directory by default; you can specify a custom folder by using the `-p` option):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/mithril/refs/heads/main/mithril-install.sh | sh -s -- -c mithril-signer -d 2450.0 -p $(pwd)
```
