### Certification of Cardano stake distribution

:::info Update 2024/10/21

We have released stable support for the **Cardano stake distribution certification** with distributions [2437](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2437.1) and [2442](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2442.0).

A threshold of at least **70%** of the stake running version `0.2.182` (within **10** days after the distribution `2442` is released) is mandatory to activate the certification of the Cardano stake distribution on the `release-mainnet` network.

The [Mithril Protocol Insights](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/mbL23-8gibI) dashboard displays the adoption rate of the different signer versions on the `release-mainnet` network.

:::

With the release of the new distribution [2437](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2437.1), we have started to roll-out the certification of the **Cardano stake distribution** in the Mithril networks.

The Mithril network now provides certified Cardano stake distribution data without requiring a full Cardano node, a useful feature for applications such as bridges and layer 2 solutions. The key features include:

- Certification of the Cardano stake distribution of the ending epoch at each epoch transition.
- New HTTP routes in the Aggregator REST API to access this certified data.
- Updates to the Mithril client library and CLI for retrieving and verifying Cardano stake distribution.
- WASM client support for these functionalities.
- Mithril Explorer now displays certified Cardano stake distribution.

The roll-out plan of the feature is the following:

- [x] Distribution [2437](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2437.1):
  - [x] Activation of the certification of **Cardano stake distribution** in the `pre-release-preview` network.
  - [x] Activation of the certification of **Cardano stake distribution** in the `release-preprod` network.
- [x] Distribution [2442](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2442.0):
  - [ ] Activation of the certification of **Cardano stake distribution** in the `release-mainnet` network.
